Experiments with Raspberry Pi ... (& practicing linked lists)

### Little Ms Ridinghood game: 

   **Little Ms Ridinghood** with her red cap is standing at the edge of the forest. 
   She is scared to get lost in the woods. You use the joy stick to create a path for her.
   Once there is a complete path that exits the forest again somewhere, she will follow
   the path and live happily ever after. 

   The 'game' is an adaptation of the snake game code found in the SenseHat_Sample-Files 
   that come with the SenseHat compoent (includes LED matrix & joy-stick (plus some 
   sensors not used in this game)).

   @author of the adaptations: Anna Malchow-Perryman (https://github.com/apman/Raspberry)  

   **To run the game** you need a Raspberry Pi connected to a SenseHat component. 
   Switch to the littleMsRidingHood folder:

```
$ make
$ ./red
```
