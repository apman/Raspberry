Experiments with Raspberry Pi ...

The littleMsRidingHood folder contains a little game: 

   This little game is about Little Ms Ridinghood standing at the edge of the forest. 
   She is scared to get lost in the woods. You use the joy stick to create a path for her.
   Once there is a complete path that exits the forest again somewhere, she will follow
   the path and live happily ever after. 

   The game is an adaptation of the snake game code found in the SenseHat_Sample-Files 
   that come with the SenseHat (the compoent with the LED matrix & joy-stick (plus some 
   sensors not used in this game).

   To run the game you need a Raspberry Pi connecte to a SenseHat component. 
   Then simmply switch to the littleMsRidingHood folder:

   $ make
   $ ./red
